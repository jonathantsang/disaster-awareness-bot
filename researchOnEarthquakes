research on earthquakes:

out doors:
- Move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.
- Once in the open, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings, at exits and alongside exterior walls.

in doors:
- DROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops.
- DO NOT use the elevators
- Stay in bed if you are there when the earthquake strikes

minigame ideas:

outdoors:
- outdoors, avoid buildings, utility wires, streetlights
- go to open area

indoors:
- choose between places to go to when there is an earthquake, bed or elevator (randomized)
